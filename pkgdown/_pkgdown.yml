  - title: "virgo basics"
    desc: >
      To create a virgo graphic pass your data into `vega()`, and supply some
      visual encodings `enc()`. You can then add layers with the `%>%`,
      and write the results to a file.
    contents:
      - vega
      - enc
      - starts_with("%")
      - starts_with("vw_write")
  - title: "Layers"
    desc: >
      To add visual layers to a graphic, you need to specify a mark which
      depends on your data and visual encoding.
    contents:
      - starts_with("mark_")
  - title: "Scales"
    desc: >
      To modify how encodings are translated from the data to the visual
      appearance of a graphic you need to specify a scale.
    contents:
      - starts_with("scale_")
  - title: "Facets and Concatenation"
    desc: >
      To generate small multiples and display different subsets of the data,
      you need to facet. To layout graphics along side one another you need
      to concatenate
    contents:
      - facet_views
      - vconcat
      - hconcat
      - resolve_views
  - title: "Interactivity"
    desc: >
      Interactivity allows you to manipulate a **virgo** graphic, either through
      direct selection using the `select_` functions or by binding data to an
      interface like a button or slider with the `input_` functions. These
      selections can drive aesthetic transformations of a graphic or the data. See
      `vignette("selections.Rmd")` for details
    contents:
      - encode_if
      - starts_with("select_")
      - starts_with("input_")
  - title: "Data transformations"
    desc: >
      Data transformations can performed directly on the client with the
      `vg_` family of functions.
    contents:
      - starts_with("vg_")
  - title: "Customisation"
    desc: >
      The appearance of a **virgo** graphic can be configured to modify
      all the non-data elements of a chart.
    contents:
      - config
  - title: "Data"
    desc: >
      **virgo** comes built in with the following data sets
